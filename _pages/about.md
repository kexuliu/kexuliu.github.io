Hi there! I am a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Applied Mathematics at the School of Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT). 

I am currently a Research Intern at the [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K6zhweAAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I conducted research under the guidance of [Prof. Xi Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GeGgmfoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at NJUPT.
