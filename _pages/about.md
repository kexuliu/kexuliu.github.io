I am a final-year undergraduate in Information and Computational Science at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT). I currently work under the guidance of Prof. Xi Shao in the Auditory Intelligence Computing Lab, where I lead a project focused on synthetic speech anti-spoofing. This research, supported by the National Undergraduate Innovation Training Program, aims to improve model performance across different spoofing techniques.

I am also a Research Assistant at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, working with Prof. Zhizheng Wu on DeepFake detection in audio and speech processing. Recently, I contributed to a project on adversarial attack detection, where I helped develop a DeepFake detection model designed to adapt quickly to new types of fake content.

My research interests include Generative Model Safety, Deepfake Detection, and Unsupervised Learning, with a focus on building safe and reliable AI systems.
